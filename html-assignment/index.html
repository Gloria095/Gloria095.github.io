        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>I'm currently enrolled in Algonquin College's <abbr>Interctive Media Design</abbr>. My hobbies include running at least
            10k every day, taking photos, spending time with friends and family, and looking for the good in everything. I
            consider myself to be a reliable and amusing individual. Running allows me to clear my mind while also keeping me
            physically fit, whereas photography allows me to capture memories and moments. I also value my friendships and
            family relationships, and I always make time for them. <em>In the future, I hope to use my education and passions to
            create meaningful and impactful design work.</em>
