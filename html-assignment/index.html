        <h2 align="center">About me!</h2>
        <p align="center">I was born and raised in Paraguay and now live with my older brother in Ottawa, Canada. We moved here two
            years ago and I couldn't be more pleased with our decision. Ottawa is a wonderful city with excellent
            security and much to offer. I enjoy discovering the city and everything it has to offer. Being here with my
            brother enhances the experience. I'm grateful for the opportunities afforded by living in Canada, and I'm
            looking forward to what the future holds.</p>
        <p align="center">I'm currently enrolled in Algonquin College's <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD</abbr>. My hobbies
            include running at least
            10k every day, taking photos, spending time with friends and family, and looking for the good in everything.
            I
            consider myself to be a reliable and amusing individual. Running allows me to clear my mind while also
            keeping me
            physically fit, whereas photography allows me to capture memories and moments. I also value my friendships
            and
            family relationships, and I always make time for them. <em>In the future, I hope to use my education and
                passions to
                create meaningful and impactful design work.</em>
