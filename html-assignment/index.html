        <p>As for my hobbies, I have a strong passion for both running and photography. I run almost every day and try to make it a daily routine. I love the feeling of pushing myself to run longer distances and my current record is a 15k run. I'm always striving to push myself further and I want to see just how far I can go.
        When I'm not running, I love to explore my creative side with photography. I believe that photography has the power to describe anything and tell a story without words. I enjoy capturing moments, whether it's a beautiful landscape, an interesting object, or a candid shot of someone. I love the way that a single image can evoke so many emotions and memories. Photography is a form of self-expression for me, and it allows me to express my creative side in a way that I find truly fulfilling.</p>
