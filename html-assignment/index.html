        <p>As for my hobbies, I have a strong passion for both running and photography. Running is something that I do
            almost every day, I try to make it a daily routine. I love the feeling of pushing myself to run longer
            distances, and my current record is a 15k run. I'm always striving to push myself further and I want to see
            just how far I can go.
            When I'm not running, I love to explore my creative side with photography. I believe that photography has
            the power to describe anything, to tell a story without words. I enjoy capturing moments, whether it's a
            beautiful landscape, an interesting object or a candid shot of someone. I love the way that a single image
            can evoke so many emotions and memories. Photography is a form of self-expression for me, and it allows me
            to express my creative side in a way that I find truly fulfilling.</p>
