<body>

    <h3> &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</h3>
    <p>The body element contains all the content of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and
        more.</p>
    <h3>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</h3>

    <p>The head element contains meta information about the document, such as the title of the page, which is displayed
        in the browser's tab, and link to other resources like CSS files.
    </p>

    <h3>&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</h3>

    <p>Is a block-level element used for grouping HTML elements and applying styles to those elements. It provides a way
        to structure the content of a web page into sections and does not have any semantic meaning, meaning it does not
        describe the content it contains.
    </p>

    <h3>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;</h3>

    <p>Is a heading tag used to create the main heading of a web page. It is typically used as the title or top-level
        heading of a document, and it is usually the largest text on the page. The tag has semantic meaning,
            meaning it describes the content it contains and helps to create a clear outline for the structure of the
            web page.
    </p>

    <h3>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</h3>

    <p>The paragraph element is used to create paragraphs of text on a web page.
